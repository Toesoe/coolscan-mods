# Firmware Dumps

This directory contains unmodified firmware dumps, to be used in case the original
firmware gets corrupted and the scanner must be repaired.
Use a FLASH programmer like TL866 to program those dumps into chips. It's *not*
possible to restore such a dump over USB, and as such the dumps are of limited use,
mostly to professional scanner repairmen.
